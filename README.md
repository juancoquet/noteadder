# Note Adder

### An audiovisual education tool for beginner musicians.

Note Adder helps beginner musicians to learn and develop intuitions about rhythmic music notation by combining visual and auditory aspects. Users can build rhythmic musical phrases by dragging and dropping interactive UI elements that represent musical notes, and their creation is translated into music notation in real time. The user can also play back their creation to hear how it sounds, helping them understand how different musical note values relate to each other.

Built using JavaScipt, Python (Django), Docker, HTML/CSS.
